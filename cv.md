_**About me**_

Hello. My name is Aksana. I was born in the Minsk and I live here now. I chose the IT sphere because it is interesting, in demand on the labor market, you can work remotely from home, you can work from any country, work involves constant learning new things. I entered to study at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radiophysics for a retraining course based on higher education as a web programmer. Additionally, she began her studies at Rolling Scopes Scholl to strengthen her knowledge.
My English is currently at A2 level. I study it on my own from playlists on YouTube and books. It is very exciting. I really want to work as a Frontend deloveper and hope that I have sufficient skills for this position.
